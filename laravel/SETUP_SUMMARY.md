## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install the Vue.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**
   Run the following command to start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec app npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   You should see the example Vue.js component rendered on the page.

4. **Start Developing**
   - Create new Vue.js components in the `resources/js/components` directory
   - Register them in `resources/js/app.js`
   - Use them in your Blade templates

## Important Notes

- The Docker setup already includes Node.js and npm, so no changes were needed to the Docker configuration.
- The application is configured to use Vite for asset compilation, which provides fast hot module replacement during development.
- Vue.js components can be placed directly in the backend folder as requested, specifically in the `resources/js/components` directory.
- The frontend folder is not being used as specified in the requirements.
